# MyBookList App

Welcome to the MyBookList App repository! This project is a web application built using React, JavaScript, and Material-UI, aimed at creating and managing a reading list of books. The app leverages the Google Books API to allow users to search for books, add them to their list, and organize them using various tags. The application is also backed by a database (backend technology to be determined, likely using Supabase) to provide data persistence and storage.

**The project can be found here:** https://mybooklist-project.netlify.app/

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to develop a quality web application using Test Driven Development (TDD) principles. My learning objectives from this are:

- Gain hands-on experience with Test Driven Development (TDD) techniques.
- Learn how to write effective tests that drive the development process.
- Improve your skills in crafting maintainable and well-tested code.

The MyBookList App allows users to:

- Search for books using the Google Books API.
- Add books to a personal reading list.
- Organize books using tags.
- Backend support provided through a database (backend technology to be determined, likely using Supabase).

## Features

- User authentication and authorization.
- Search and browse books using Google Books API.
- Add books to a personal reading list.
- Organize books by applying tags.
- Backend database for data storage and retrieval.
- Quality codebase developed through Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.

## Tech Stack

The BookList App is built using the following technologies:

- React
- JavaScript
- Material-UI
- [Backend technology to be determined, likely Supabase]

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

The BookList App is developed using a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach. TDD involves writing tests before writing the actual code. This helps ensure code quality, maintainability, and that new features do not break existing functionality. To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
